Static gallery site ported from local workspace.

This repository contains an HTML/CSS static site (login, signup, gallery, and several artwork pages).

How to run locally:
- Open any .html file in your browser (e.g., `index.html` or `gallery.html`).

Notes:
- Images are hotlinked from Unsplash and Pexels.
- If you want to serve locally, use a simple static server (e.g., Python: `python -m http.server`).
